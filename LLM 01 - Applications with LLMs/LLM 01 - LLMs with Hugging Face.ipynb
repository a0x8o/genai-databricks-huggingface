       "But it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\n",

       "\"The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,\" said Mrs Hale.\n",
       "The prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.\n",
       "She told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.\n",
       "Mrs Hale said: \"The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.\"\n",
       "She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.\n",
       "Mrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.\n",

       "Glasgow lost hooker Pat McArthur to an early shoulder injury but took advantage of their first pressure when Rory Clegg slotted over a penalty on 12 minutes.\n",
       "It took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards.\n",
       "Glasgow struck back when Fusaro drove over from a rolling maul on 35 minutes for Clegg to convert.\n",
       "But the Dragons levelled at 10-10 before half-time when Naiyaravoro was yellow-carded for an aerial tackle on Brew and Tovey slotted the easy goal.\n",
       "The visitors could not make the most of their one-man advantage after the break as their error count cost them dearly.\n",

       "The Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes.\n",
       "However, Favaro became sinner-turned-saint as he got on the end of another effective rolling maul to earn his side the extra point with the last move of the game, Clegg converting.\n",

         "Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn't\".\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details",

       "As they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.\n",
       "One of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\n",
       "The driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\n",
       "Both groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\n",

       "The world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\n",
       "But stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\n",
       "Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\n",
       "Vandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn't\".\n",
       "Mercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\n",
       "After the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\n",
       "But Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\n",
       "Vettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\n",
       "The gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\n",
       "Vettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\n",
       "Vandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\n",
       "The Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\n",
       "He also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\n",
       "Button was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\n",
       "The 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n",
       "\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\n",
       "Button, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\n",
       "The controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\n",
       "FIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\n",
       "The system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\n",
       "But it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\n",
       "Only one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\n",
       "The teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\n",
       "Todt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n",
       "\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\n",
       "Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\n",

       "Mr Bates denies all the charges.\n",
       "Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.\n",
       "\"The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,\" said Mrs Hale.\n",
       "The prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.\n",
       "She told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.\n",
       "Mrs Hale said: \"The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.\"\n",
       "She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.\n",
       "Mrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.\n",

       "Rynard Landman and Ashton Hewitt got a try in either half for the Dragons.\n",
       "Glasgow showed far superior strength in depth as they took control of a messy match in the second period.\n",
       "Home coach Gregor Townsend gave a debut to powerhouse Fijian-born Wallaby wing Taqele Naiyaravoro, and centre Alex Dunbar returned from long-term injury, while the Dragons gave first starts of the season to wing Aled Brew and hooker Elliot Dee.\n",
       "Glasgow lost hooker Pat McArthur to an early shoulder injury but took advantage of their first pressure when Rory Clegg slotted over a penalty on 12 minutes.\n",
       "It took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards.\n",
       "Glasgow struck back when Fusaro drove over from a rolling maul on 35 minutes for Clegg to convert.\n",
       "But the Dragons levelled at 10-10 before half-time when Naiyaravoro was yellow-carded for an aerial tackle on Brew and Tovey slotted the easy goal.\n",
       "The visitors could not make the most of their one-man advantage after the break as their error count cost them dearly.\n",
       "It was Glasgow's bench experience that showed when Mike Blair's break led to a short-range score from teenage prop Fagerson, converted by Clegg.\n",
       "Debutant Favaro was the second home player to be sin-binned, on 63 minutes, but again the Warriors made light of it as replacement wing Bulumakau, a recruit from the Army, pounced to deftly hack through a bouncing ball for an opportunist try.\n",
       "The Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes.\n",
       "However, Favaro became sinner-turned-saint as he got on the end of another effective rolling maul to earn his side the extra point with the last move of the game, Clegg converting.\n",
       "Dragons director of rugby Lyn Jones said: \"We're disappointed to have lost but our performance was a lot better [than against Leinster] and the game could have gone either way.\n",
       "\"Unfortunately too many errors behind the scrum cost us a great deal, though from where we were a fortnight ago in Dublin our workrate and desire was excellent.\n",
       "\"It was simply error count from individuals behind the scrum that cost us field position, it's not rocket science - they were correct in how they played and we had a few errors, that was the difference.\"\n",

         "Lewis Hamilton stormed to pole position at the Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.",
         "Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn't\".\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details"

The program shall consist of all of the following components:\\n(1) Upon application for an original license, the applicant shall be issued an instruction permit pursuant to Section 12509. A person who has in his or her immediate possession a valid permit issued pursuant to Section 12509 may operate a motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle or motorized bicycle, only when the person is either taking the driver training instruction referred to in paragraph (3) or practicing that instruction, provided the person is accompanied by, and is under the immediate supervision of, a California licensed driver 25 years of age or older whose driving privilege is not on probation. The age requirement of this paragraph does not apply if the licensed driver is the parent, spouse, or guardian of the permitholder or is a licensed or certified driving instructor.\\n(2) The person shall hold an instruction permit for not less than six months prior to applying for a provisional driver’s license.\\n(3) The person shall have complied with one of the following:\\n(A) Satisfactory completion of approved courses in automobile driver education and driver training maintained pursuant to provisions of the Education Code in any secondary school of California, or equivalent instruction in a secondary school of another state.\\n(B) Satisfactory completion of an integrated driver education and training program that is approved by the department and conducted by a driving instructor licensed under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 11100) of Division 5. The program shall utilize segmented modules, whereby a portion of the educational instruction is provided by, and then reinforced through, specific behind-the-wheel training before moving to the next phase of driver education and training. The program shall contain a minimum of 30 hours of classroom instruction and six hours of behind-the-wheel training.\\n(C) Satisfactory completion of six hours or more of behind-the-wheel instruction by a driving school or an independent driving instructor licensed under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 11100) of Division 5 and either an accredited course in automobile driver education in any secondary school of California pursuant to provisions of the Education Code or satisfactory completion of equivalent professional instruction acceptable to the department. To be acceptable to the department, the professional instruction shall meet minimum standards to be prescribed by the department, and the standards shall be at least equal to the requirements for driver education and driver training contained in the rules and regulations adopted by the State Board of Education pursuant to the Education Code. A person who has complied with this subparagraph shall not be required by the governing board of a school district to comply with subparagraph (A) in order to graduate from high school.\\n(D) Except as provided under subparagraph (B), a student shall not take driver training instruction, unless he or she has successfully completed driver education.\\n(4) The person shall complete 50 hours of supervised driving practice prior to the issuance of a provisional license, which is in addition to any other driver training instruction required by law. Not less than 10 of the required practice hours shall include driving during darkness, as defined in Section 280. Upon application for a provisional license, the person shall submit to the department the certification of a parent, spouse, guardian, or licensed or certified driving instructor that the applicant has completed the required amount of driving practice and is prepared to take the department’s driving test. A person without a parent, spouse, guardian, or who is an emancipated minor, may have a licensed driver 25 years of age or older or a licensed or certified driving instructor complete the certification. This requirement does not apply to motorcycle practice.\\n(5) The person shall successfully complete an examination required by the department. Before retaking a test, the person shall wait for not less than one week after failure of the written test and for not less than two weeks after failure of the driving test.\\n(b) Except as provided in Section 12814.7, the provisional driver’s license shall be subject to all of the following restrictions:\\n(1) Except as specified in paragraph (2), during the first 12 months after issuance of a provisional license the licensee shall not do any of the following unless accompanied and supervised by a licensed driver who is the licensee’s parent or guardian, a licensed driver who is 25 years of age or older, or a licensed or certified driving instructor:\\n(A) Drive between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.\\n(B) Transport passengers who are under 20 years of age.\\n(2) A licensee may drive between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. or transport an immediate family member without being accompanied and supervised by a licensed driver who is the licensee’s parent or guardian, a licensed driver who is 25 years of age or older, or a licensed or certified driving instructor, in the following circumstances:\\n(A) Medical necessity of the licensee when reasonable transportation facilities are inadequate and operation of a vehicle by a licensee is necessary. The licensee shall keep in his or her possession a signed statement from a physician familiar with the condition, containing a diagnosis and probable date when sufficient recovery will have been made to terminate the necessity.\\n(B)\\nSchooling\\nSchool\\nor school-authorized activities of the licensee when reasonable transportation facilities are inadequate and operation of a vehicle by a licensee is necessary.\\n(i) The licensee shall keep in his or her possession a signed statement from the school principal, dean, or school staff member designated by the principal or dean, containing a probable date that the\\nschooling\\nschool\\nor school-authorized activity will have been completed.\\n(ii) A licensee who is 18, 19, or 20 years of age may keep in his or her possession a copy of his or her class schedule as documentation to satisfy clause (i).\\n(C) Employment necessity of the licensee when reasonable transportation facilities are inadequate and operation of a vehicle by a licensee is necessary.\\n(i) The licensee shall keep in his or her possession a signed statement from the employer, verifying employment and containing a probable date that the employment will have been completed.\\n(ii) A licensee who is 18, 19, or 20 years of age may keep in his or her possession a copy of his or her work schedule as documentation to satisfy clause (i).\\n(D) Necessity of the licensee or the licensee’s immediate family member when reasonable transportation facilities are inadequate and operation of a vehicle by a licensee is necessary to transport the licensee or the licensee’s immediate family member. The licensee shall keep in his or her possession a signed statement from a parent or legal guardian verifying the reason and containing a probable date that the necessity will have ceased. If reasonable transportation facilities are inadequate and operation of a vehicle by a licensee who is 18, 19, or 20 years of age is necessary to transport the licensee or the licensee’s immediate family member, a signed statement by a parent or legal guardian is not required.\\n(E) The licensee is an emancipated minor.\\n(c) A law enforcement officer shall not stop a vehicle for the sole purpose of determining whether the driver is in violation of the restrictions imposed under subdivision (b).\\n(d) A law enforcement officer shall not stop a vehicle for the sole purpose of determining whether a driver who is subject to the license restrictions in subdivision (b) is in violation of Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 118947) of Chapter 4 of Part 15 of Division 104 of the Health and Safety Code.\\n(e) (1) Upon a finding that any licensee has violated paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), the court shall impose one of the following:\\n(A) Not less than eight hours nor more than 16 hours of community service for a first offense and not less than 16 hours nor more than 24 hours of community service for a second or subsequent offense.\\n(B) A fine of not more than thirty-five dollars ($35) for a first offense and a fine of not more than fifty dollars ($50) for a second or subsequent offense.\\n(2) If the court orders community service, the court shall retain jurisdiction until the hours of community service have been completed.\\n(3) If the hours of community service have not been completed within 90 days, the court shall impose a fine of not more than thirty-five dollars ($35) for a first offense and not more than fifty dollars ($50) for a second or subsequent offense.\\n(f) A conviction of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), when reported to the department, shall not be disclosed as otherwise specified in Section 1808 or constitute a violation point count value pursuant to Section 12810.\\n(g) Any term of restriction or suspension of the driving privilege imposed on a person pursuant to this subdivision shall remain in effect until the end of the term even though the person becomes 21 years of age before the term ends.\\n(1) The driving privilege shall be suspended when the record of the person shows one or more notifications issued pursuant to Section 40509 or 40509.5. The suspension shall continue until any notification issued pursuant to Section 40509 or 40509.5 has been cleared.\\n(2) A 30-day restriction shall be imposed when a driver’s record shows a violation point count of two or more points in 12 months, as determined in accordance with Section 12810. The restriction shall require the licensee to be accompanied by a licensed parent, spouse, guardian, or other licensed driver 25 years of age or older, except when operating a class M vehicle, or so licensed, with no passengers aboard.\\n(3) A six-month suspension of the driving privilege and a one-year term of probation shall be imposed whenever a licensee’s record shows a violation point count of three or more points in 12 months, as determined in accordance with Section 12810. The terms and conditions of probation shall include, but not be limited to, both of the following:\\n(A) The person shall not violate any law that, if resulting in conviction, is reportable to the department under Section 1803.\\n(B) The person shall remain free from accident responsibility.\\n(h) Whenever action by the department under subdivision (g) arises as a result of a motor vehicle accident, the person may, in writing and within 10 days, demand a hearing to present evidence that he or she was not responsible for the accident upon which the action is based. Whenever action by the department is based upon a conviction reportable to the department under Section 1803, the person has no right to a hearing pursuant to Article 3 (commencing with Section 14100) of Chapter 3.\\n(i) The department shall require a person whose driving privilege is suspended or revoked pursuant to subdivision (g) to submit proof of financial responsibility as defined in Section 16430. The proof of financial responsibility shall be filed on or before the date of reinstatement following the suspension or revocation. The proof of financial responsibility shall be maintained with the department for three years following the date of reinstatement.\\n(j) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the department may issue a distinctive driver’s license, that displays a distinctive color or a distinctively colored stripe or other distinguishing characteristic, to persons at least 16 years of age and older but under 18 years of age, and to persons 18 years of age and older but under 21 years of age, so that the distinctive license feature is immediately recognizable. The features shall clearly differentiate between driver’s licenses issued to persons at least 16 years of age or older but under 18 years of age and to persons 18 years of age or older but under 21 years of age.\\n(2) If changes in the format or appearance of driver’s licenses are adopted pursuant to this subdivision, those changes may be implemented under any new contract for the production of driver’s licenses entered into after the adoption of those changes.\\n(k) The department shall include, on the face of the provisional driver’s license, the original issuance date of the provisional driver’s license in addition to any other issuance date.\\n(l) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Brady-Jared Teen Driver Safety Act of 1997.\\nSEC. 2.\\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\\u2009B of the California Constitution.',\n",
       " 'summary': 'Existing law, the Brady-Jared Teen Driver Safety Act of 1997, establishes a provisional licensing program and generally requires that a driver’s license issued to a person at least 16 years of age but under 18 years of age be issued pursuant to that provisional licensing program. During the first 12 months after issuance of a provisional license, existing law prohibits the licensee from driving between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. and transporting passengers who are under 20 years of age, unless he or she is accompanied and supervised by a licensed driver, as specified, or a licensed or certified driving instructor. Existing law provides limited exceptions to these restrictions under which a licensee is authorized to drive under specified circumstances, including a\\nschooling\\nschool\\nor school-authorized activity or an employment necessity, and requires the licensee to keep certain supporting documentation in his or her possession. A violation of these provisions is punishable as an infraction.\\nThis bill would expand the scope of the provisional licensing program by extending the applicable age range for the program from 16 to under 18 years of age to 16 to under 21 years of age. By expanding the scope of the provisional licensing program, the violation of which constitutes an infraction, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize a licensee who is 18, 19, or 20 years of age to keep in his or her possession a copy of his or her class schedule or work schedule as documentation to satisfy the exceptions for\\nschooling\\na school\\nor school-authorized activity and employment necessity, respectively, and would provide that a signed statement by a parent or legal guardian is not required if reasonable transportation facilities are inadequate and the operation of a vehicle by a licensee who is 18, 19, or 20 years of age is necessary to transport the licensee or the licensee’s immediate family member. The bill would make other\\ntechnical and\\nconforming changes.\\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.',\n",

For more details, see the [Google blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html), [code on GitHub](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer), or the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf).  For our purposes, it supports translation for English, French, Romanian, and German."

    "\n",
    "You may see parameters like `num_beams`, `do_sample`, etc. specified in Hugging Face pipelines.  These are inference configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs work by predicting (generating) the next token, then the next, and so on.  The goal is to generate a high probability sequence of tokens, which is essentially a search through the (enormous) space of potential sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this search, LLMs use one of two main methods:\n",
    "* **Search**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next most likely token in a \"search.\"\n",
    "   * **Greedy search** (default): Pick the single next most likely token in a greedy search.\n",
    "   * **Beam search**: Greedy search can be extended via beam search, which searches down several sequence paths, via the parameter `num_beams`.\n",
    "* **Sampling**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next token by sampling from the predicted distribution of tokens.\n",
    "   * **Top-K sampling**: The parameter `top_k` modifies sampling by limiting it to the `k` most likely tokens.\n",
    "   * **Top-p sampling**: The parameter `top_p` modifies sampling by limiting it to the most likely tokens up to probability mass `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can toggle between search and sampling via parameter `do_sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more background on search and sampling, see [this Hugging Face blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).\n",

The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details"
